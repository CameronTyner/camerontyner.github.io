A 5th semester course covering advanced topics in .NET development as a followup to the 3rd semester course. The course
was challenged due to a change in instructor as well as COVID-19 closing the school (classes were continued online). A
5th assignment covering design patterns was planned but was dropped to a COVID-19 accommodation plan. There was a group
component, assignment 3 was done in small teams. Unit tests were required on all assignments. I received a grade of 99%
overall in the course.

The following topics were covered:
<ul>
<li>Week 1 - Intro</li>
<li>Week 2 - LINQ and Lambda</li>
<li>Week 3 - Expression Trees</li>
<li>Week 4 - Reflection</li>
<li>Week 5 - Attributes and Serialization</li>
<li>Week 6 - Asynchronous Programming Part 1</li>
<li>Week 7 - Asynchronous Programming Part 2</li>
<li>Week 8 - HTTP Applications</li>
<li>Week 9 - WebSockets</li>
<li>Week 10 - Multithreading</li>
<li>Week 11 - Design Patterns Part 1</li>
<li>Week 12 - Design Patterns Part 2</li>
<li>Week 13 - Design Principles</li>
<li>Week 14 - Final exam (worth 25% of the grade)</li>
</ul>

The following assignments were given, worth 75% of the grade:
<ul>
<li>Assignment 1 – Expression Trees</li>
<li>Assignment 2 – Serialization Class Library</li>
<li>Assignment 3 – Server Application</li>
<li>Assignment 4 – Realtime Chatroom</li>
</ul>
