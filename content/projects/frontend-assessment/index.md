A front-end replication assessment created using Vue.js, based on images, videos, and functional requirements. Data
from an external JSON API of fictional students is retrieved and styled to match the requirements. An array of grades is
averaged. Tags can be added to the students. The students can be filtered based on first name and last name, and by tag.
